One such player who has quietly been making waves and defying expectations is none other than Bruno Fernandes. Despite his outstanding performances and consistent impact on the pitch, Fernandes has often been overlooked and underrated in discussions about the world\u2019s best footballers. However, a closer look at his game reveals a player who embodies the essence of a true football maestro.<\/p>\n<p>Name a more consistent yet underrated player in the Premier league and even in the world. I\u2019ll wait\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Since his arrival at Manchester United in January 2020, Fernandes has been a revelation. His impact on the team and the Premier League has been nothing short of extraordinary, yet his contributions have frequently been overshadowed by more high-profile names in the footballing world. It is time to shed light on the immense talent and significance that Bruno Fernandes brings to the beautiful game.<\/p>\n<p>If you can put banter and team allegiance aside you would get to know why he is one of if not the best players to have graced the Premier league from the time of his arrival till now.<\/p>\n<p>Fernandes has had his own fair share of criticism over the years he has been at United especially due to the fact that he is perceived to complain and moan about every decision that doesn\u2019t go his way or his way of his team and also with the fact that he sometimes likes to go for the more intricate passes to his teammates which sometimes can be dangerous in the sense that it causes immediate turnovers to the opposition side when could probably well lead to a big chance or in some cases a goal.<\/p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t take away the fact that the Portuguese maestro has been one of the most important players this season for Erik ten Hag and that\u2019s why Fernandes earns so much praise and adulation from his manager and everyone associated with the club.<\/p>\n<p>You should listen to the stadium when he goes over to take a corner\u2026 Deafening!<\/p>\n<p>But why is Fernandes so unique? What makes him an integral part of his sides for both club and country?<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of reasons why he\u2019s one of the most complete midfielders in the Premier league and on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the most complete\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll give you the reasons why.<\/p>\n<p>Read on!<\/p>\n<p>Portugal and United\u2019s number 8 possesses exceptional vision and creative prowess that enables him unlock stubborn defenses and create multiple chances for his teammates. He is blessed with the art of passing a football so precisely that it ends up in assists because they usually end up becoming big chances. Marcus Rashford has benefited greatly from this skillset the Portuguese maestro possess because he is most of the time on the end of it all he has that killer instinct to finish everything off.<\/p>\n<p>A quite deadly combination\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Bruno Fernandes alongside Marcus Rashford.<br \/>\nUnited\u2019s lack of a classic number nine this term would be one of the reasons why Fernandes was unable to rack up a double digit of assists this term in the league. With his -6.4 expected assists, it\u2019s way more than any player in the top five leagues across Europe but if ten Hag\u2019s side are to get in a good striker then I\u2019m sure Bruno\u2019s numbers would improve massively in that respect. Bruno had eight assists in the Premier league and fifteen in all competitions.<\/p>\n<p>Adding to the fact that he has a good passing range, Bruno Fernandes is not just your average playmaking midfielder because he also knows where the goal is and has a remarkable ability of finding the back of the net from various positions on the field. His accurate long-range shooting, set-piece expertise, and intelligent positioning make him a constant threat to opposing teams. United fans would remember his goal against Everton in 2021 as an example of his shooting ability.<\/p>\n<p>An absolute peach!<\/p>\n<p>It goes to show he can\u2019t only just score from penalties.<\/p>\n<p>Fernandes also has eight goals this term in the league and thirteen all competitions.<\/p>\n<p>Wait, this man pulled a 28 goal contribution right under our noses and it\u2019s not talked about. That\u2019s crazy!<\/p>\n<p>Fernandes consistently performs at a high level, delivering strong performances in almost every game he plays. His ability to maintain a consistent level in his performance in a United shirt has made him such a dependable player for The Red Devils coupled with the fact that he is never injured and the times he has been out of the side Manchester United have lost the games or have suffered in the games. They just don\u2019t look a complete and attacking team without Fernandes pulling the strings in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Wait that\u2019s not all\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The Midfield man is also a very versatile player for Erik ten Hag\u2019s setup this season and has showed that he can play in numerous positions on the pitch. Bruno has played as an attacking midfielder, as a number 8 and even as a deep lying midfielder at times. In the attacking third he can play as a false nine and of both flanks.<\/p>\n<p>I bet he\u2019d probably give De Gea a run for his money in goal too\u2026<\/p>\n<p>His versatility provides tactical flexibility for the team in terms of how he can slot in for players unavailable or just being there for tactical tweaks mid games.<\/p>\n<p>CONCLUSION.<br \/>\nBruno Fernandes has the most chances created in the league this season with 32 (119.0) and is only second to Lionel Messi in Europe\u2019s top five leagues in that category.<\/p>\n<p>Martinez, Casemiro and Rashford would be given a shout for who the most important player was this season for Manchester United but for me personally, Bruno Fernandes has been the most important player in United by a mile and has been the best signing for the club post Fergie era. If you are looking at consistency and availability then he\u2019s right up there.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Bruno Fernandes\u2019 impact on Manchester United cannot be overstated. His combination of creativity, goal-scoring ability, leadership, consistency, and versatility make him a crucial player for the team. His presence on the field significantly enhances United\u2019s attacking threat and overall performance.<\/p>\n<p>Do you think he\u2019s still underrated?<\/p>\n<p>Do you agree with me that he has been United\u2019s most important player this season?<\/p>\n<p>Let me know below in the comments!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you everyone for your time and for reading up until now.<\/p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoyed your time on this page.<\/p>\n<p>Please do not forget to leave a like, comment and also share to people of similar interests as that would help me a lot.

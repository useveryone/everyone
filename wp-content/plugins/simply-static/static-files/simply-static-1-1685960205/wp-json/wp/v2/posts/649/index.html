In comparison, last year, the Red Devils finished a lowly sixth, with only 58 points.<\/p>\n<p>The Red Devils also finally won a trophy by clinching the League Cup in February 2023, the team\u2019s first piece of silverware since 2017. Ten Hag\u2019s team also reached the final of the FA Cup, and for periods of the season, Man Utd finally looked like a top team again, capable of going toe to toe with the best in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the positives, there were also some negatives. The most important negative would be the gap to champions Manchester City, who scored 89 points to clinch another title.<\/p>\n<p>Man Utd also showed a tendency to capitulate in some away games when things did not go according to plans. The most humiliating such episode was a 7\u20130 thumping suffered against arch-rivals Liverpool, but a 6\u20133 defeat against City, a 4\u20130 defeat against Brentford, and a 3\u20130 loss against Sevilla were also bitter pills to swallow for Man Utd fans.<\/p>\n<p>This would be my review in short, but let\u2019s look at the facts a bit more in detail.<\/p>\n<p>Since the start of the season last summer, rumors were going wild about the rocky relationship between the new manager Erik ten Hag, and the team\u2019s star player Cristiano Ronaldo.<\/p>\n<p>Ten Hag only played Ronaldo sporadically until the World Cup break arrived in November, then came the famous Piers Morgan interview that ended Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Man Utd career.<\/p>\n<p>Opinions were divided on whether United would be better off without Ronaldo or not, but with the assistance of hindsight, I think we can safely say now that the team was better off without Ronaldo.<\/p>\n<p>And statistics back up this assertion. Up until the World Cup break, United\u2019s track record in the league was 8 wins, 2 draws, and 4 losses after 14 games, leaving them fifth in the standings with a win percentage of 57%.<\/p>\n<p>In the last 24 games of the season, United won 15 out of 24 league games, drew 3 times, and lost 5 times, rising to third in the standings with a win percentage of 62%.<\/p>\n<p>Between late December and early March, United was also playing some excellent football, which saw them edge Xavi\u2019s Barcelona in the Europe League, defeat Pep Guardiola\u2019s Man City in the Manchester derby, and clinch the League Cup against Newcastle.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the team\u2019s form tailed off after March, and more patchy results came, as the pressure of too many games began to be seen, and some of the key players were forced to miss games through injury while others looked more and more tired.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, despite the hot and cold last three months of the season, I think ten Hag can be relatively happy with his first season at Old Trafford.<\/p>\n<p>He succeeded in establishing himself as the top dog in the United dressing room, something Ralph Rangnick seemingly never succeeded in doing last year. The team seemingly also took the side of the manager in the feud between ten Hag and Ronaldo in the autumn, and the results improved in the aftermath of the World Cup.<\/p>\n<p>During periods of the season, Man Utd also showed a winning team mentality and were not intimidated by going up against some of the best teams in Europe home or away.<\/p>\n<p>Still, ten Hag knows that third place and a League Cup will not be enough to keep him at Old Trafford in the long run, as these are good results during a transitional season like this one, but the fans will be demanding improvements in the upcoming season(s).<\/p>\n<p>The Dutch manager no doubt also knows what were the weaknesses that saw his team fall 14 points behind Man City in the standings.<\/p>\n<p>First and most important issue for Man Utd to fix would be a lack of goals.<\/p>\n<p>Just like last season, this year also, Man Utd struggled for goals and ended the 38-round league with a mere 58 goals. Compared to Man City\u2019s 94, or Arsenal\u2019s 88, Man Utd\u2019s tally is very modest, and it is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently if the Red Devils want to challenge their rivals in the 2023\/24 season.<\/p>\n<p>Many players were already rumored to have been on the shopping list of the team, with Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen being at the top of the list of most fans.<\/p>\n<p>The argument for Kane would be that he is already a seasoned veteran in the Premier League who has already shown that he got what it takes to succeed in England. Osimhen is a lot less accomplished than Kane and only really broke into stardom this year, but the 24-year-old Nigerian was one of the players of the season and played a major part in Napoli\u2019s conquest of the Seria A.<\/p>\n<p>If I could choose, I\u2019d probably go for Kane as a safe pair of boots, but I\u2019d be delighted if we could lend Osimhen also, as I think he is a super player with huge potential and a long career ahead of him.<\/p>\n<p>Another issue that needs to be addressed urgently is the squad depth of Man Utd.<\/p>\n<p>For me, the main reason why the form of the team tailed off in the spring was the lack of squad depth.<\/p>\n<p>Though I was delighted to see Man Utd progress in all cup competitions during the winter months, this also meant that the team had an incredibly congested schedule, playing two games per week for months, and for the thin squad of Man Utd, this was unfortunately just too much this season.<\/p>\n<p>Christian Eriksen went out injured for nearly two months, while Marcus Rashford was also far from fully fit in the last weeks of the season. Errors of judgment and tiredness also crept in during the spring, as the tiring Man Utd XI was stretched to its limit when ten Hag was unable to rotate his key players.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, 5\u20136 quality players should be signed this summer to both improve the starting XI in such positions as goalkeeper, full-backs, midfield, and attack, but also to give ten Hag more options to rotate during the season and keep his key players fresh for the really important games.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is probably more wishful thinking than reality, but the signing of a good goalkeeper, central midfielder, and forward should be an absolute must for the Red Devils if they want to improve next season.<\/p>\n<p>Who these players might be is a difficult question. Rumors are going wild as usual. According to some, besides Kane and Osimhen, ten Hag is looking to sign Portugal\u2019s Diogo Costa to bring competition for David de Gea, while West Ham skipper Declan Rice and Chelsea\u2019s Mason Mount are also rumored to be among the potential signings requested by ten Hag.<\/p>\n<p>Even if these three areas could be strengthened, ten Hag\u2019s squad would lack the depth Pep Guardiola has, but this should allow ten Hag to close the gap to Man City and make his team a more promising prospect for talented players who would want to try their luck in the Premier League.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, I would say that as a fan, overall, I am happy with the job Erik ten Hag did at Old Trafford during the last 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>Though I, like most other fans, expect to see improvements, we should remain with our feet on the ground and see this as a work in progress.<\/p>\n<p>If we look at the two teams that finished ahead of us this year, we could see that neither Arteta and not even Guardiola were able to turn around their teams in 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>Ten Hag\u2019s place as a manager should not be above criticism by any means, but thanks to his track record at Ajax and his first season at Old Trafford, I think he earned the respect of the Man Utd fans, and we should trust him to be the right man to lead back United among the best teams of Europe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Another season for a Red Devil fan With the 2022\/23 season finished, it is time to review the past 12 months and highlight the positives<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":650,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.8 -

Yet despite all the attributes and measures, one statistical point remains, in part, a mystery: why does the home team enjoy an advantage?<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s been no shortage of theoretical explanations, like how crowd noise disrupts the visiting team\u2019s performance or how local referees sway calls in favor of the home team.<\/p>\n<p>These theories make sense, but, to me, the explanation is more obvious and elemental. The home team is amped up to play in front of their crowd and defend their turf, translating to an early adrenaline rush that gives them an edge when talent levels are relatively even.<\/p>\n<p>It makes sense at face value. Home team entrances are so high-energy that I once briefly confused the University Of Texas\u2019 marching band for their football team. The brass section was doing calisthenics like Jerry Rice before a playoff game. How often does this happen when the visiting team\u2019s marching band takes the field? College football stadiums are the modern-day Coliseum. Home teams are psychologically battle-ready in a way that visiting teams are not.<\/p>\n<p>Metaphors aside, I wanted to test this theory by digging into the data. My hypothesis is simple. The home team benefits from an initial rush of adrenaline that gives them a temporary bump in the game\u2019s early stages. When turning to the data, this temporary boost should be visible in a performance trend that steadily diminishes over time as adrenaline fades and stamina wanes.<\/p>\n<p>Pause here and ask yourself if you think this prediction is accurate. My guess is that you\u2019re with me because everyone knows the home team plays tough early on.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see what the data says.<\/p>\n<p>Preparing the Data And Analytics Approach<br \/>\nTo test my theory, I download game data from www.collegefootball.com (a fantastic website, check them out). To form the foundational data of my analysis, I grabbed data for 9 seasons (2013\u20132022, excluding 2020&#8217;s abnormal season). I then filtered by these criteria:<\/p>\n<p>FBS division<br \/>\nConference games<br \/>\nGames decided by 14 points or less<br \/>\nNon-Neutral site games<br \/>\nGames not decided in overtime<br \/>\nThese filters aimed to remove mismatches (conference powerhouses always win) and games where one team let off the gas in the fourth quarter after running up the score. All told the foundational data included about 2,200 games. Importantly, in these games, the home team won 53% of the time, and the away team won 47%.<\/p>\n<p>The key metric I wanted to base my analysis on was win percentages by quarter for the home and away teams. If the home team scored more points in the first quarter, they won that quarter, and so on and so forth (note that this is on a per-quarter basis and is not cumulative).<\/p>\n<p>Once I calculated the metric, I\u2019d look for a spike in the home team\u2019s win rates in the first quarter and then a gradual decline. That would at least support my theory in a general sense.<\/p>\n<p>What The Data Showed<br \/>\nHere\u2019s a summary table of the data showing the win percentages for each quarter for the home and away teams and the delta between each quarter\u2019s percentages.<\/p>\n<p>Win Percentages By Quarter, Base Data From CollegeFootballData.com<br \/>\nThere are two things I\u2019d like to point out here. First, notice that the first quarter is the only quarter with a significant difference in success rates between the home and away teams. The home team wins the first quarter ~42% of the time, while the away team wins ~37% of the time.<\/p>\n<p>The second, third, and fourth-quarter win percentages are virtually identical between the home and away teams.<\/p>\n<p>Now look at the trend line in the percentages for each team. The home team\u2019s success is near steady. In contrast, the away team improves as the game goes on.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a side-by-side visualization of the win percentages by team.<\/p>\n<p>Line Chart, Win Percentages<br \/>\nMy prediction was wrong (relative to home win rates alone, but not compared to away win rates). The home team\u2019s win rate doesn\u2019t peak early and then drop off. It stays more or less consistent. But curiously, the away team\u2019s trend line is at an incline. The away team\u2019s worst quarter is the first; they improve from there. What does this mean from my adrenaline dump theory? At this point, I\u2019m not sure.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at how the home team wins versus how the away team wins.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the tabular data side by side:<\/p>\n<p>Game Comparison: Home Wins Vs. Away Wins<br \/>\nNotice that the pattern in the percentages is the same. The home team\u2019s percentages are relatively consistent. Whereas the away team, even when it wins, sees a steady increase in success as the game progresses.<\/p>\n<p>Also, regardless of victory or defeat, one thing is consistently true for the away team, their worst quarter is always the first. Comparatively, the home team\u2019s worst quarter is always the third.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the Takeaway?<br \/>\nThe data shows that the home team has more success against the away team in the first quarter and that the away team strikes a balance in the subsequent quarters.<\/p>\n<p>But is this dynamic in any way related to home-field advantage? Does it do anything to explain why in this data set, the home team won 53% of the time?<\/p>\n<p>In a sense, yes. The data tells the big-picture story. The away team\u2019s general cadence of getting better over time results in a lesser win rate of 47%. Winning early is valuable in a competition between two teams where talent is matched evenly.<\/p>\n<p>Still, what\u2019s going on feels opaque without additional details. To add texture to the story, I included metrics for total points per quarter in the summary table. See the results below.<\/p>\n<p>Total Points By Team and Quarter<br \/>\nThe home team scores more points overall, but the real difference is in the first quarter when the home team\u2019s defense is uniquely effective.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping a focus on the first quarter, I calculated the win percentages for the home and away teams when first-quarter points were removed from the scoreboard.<\/p>\n<p>Without first-quarter points, the home team won ~48% of the time, and the away team ~46% (ties cover the remainder).<br \/>\nHome team advantage isn\u2019t erased without the first quarter, but the gap narrows. Overall, my theory feels pretty relevant from where I\u2019m sitting. Tying it Back to Adrenaline<\/p>\n<p>One often discussed theory about home-field advantage is that it\u2019s linked to crowd noise. In general, the theory holds that the home-team crowd is louder while the away team is playing offense, interfering with their ability to hear the snap count and communicate.<\/p>\n<p>But an excellent article by Josh Hermsmeyer in FiveThirtyEight undermines that theory.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is indeed a correlation between crowd attendance and home-field advantage. During the 2020 NFL season, home-field advantage was non-existent when attendance was reduced or removed entirely, as this Washington Post article by Adam Kilgore and Neil Greenberg describes, quoted below:<\/p>\n<p>Last year, with stadiums permitting either partial crowds or no fans at all, home-field advantage vanished. Road teams won more often for the first time on record, posting a .502 winning percentage.<\/p>\n<p>After learning this, I thought, by chance, the key to understanding home-field advantage was comparing the circumstances in which it does not exist. While digging through my data, I removed my filter for the FBS division out of curiosity and instead filtered for divisions II and III.<\/p>\n<p>Using this as my base data while keeping the original filters for competitive in-conference games, the significance of home-field advantage was smaller.<\/p>\n<p>It had virtually disappeared: 50.12%\/49.88%<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the breakdown of win percentages by quarter for each time was nearly an exact match:<\/p>\n<p>Win percent by team for DII and DIII<br \/>\nSowhat\u2019s the difference between a DII and DII home game and a DI home game? There are no D-Two or D-Three home games that look like this:<\/p>\n<p>Home-field advantage is, in part, about the setting. When the crowd is raucous, when the pomp and circumstance is high, players feed off that energy and play more intensely.<\/p>\n<p>That extra hype from being enmeshed in this setting gives home teams some added toughness early on. They play offense more explosively, and they play defense more aggressively.<\/p>\n<p>It could be psychology; the visiting team is a bit shaken. Or it could be physical; the home team is more explosive when their surroundings inspire them the most. In any case, the visiting team has to weather the storm before finding their pace. Then things even out. And sometimes, the home team gasses, leaving the door open for a big third quarter for the away team.<\/p>\n<p>In conditions with less energy, like the empty NFL stadiums in 2020 or the smaller DII and DIII stadiums, the home team doesn\u2019t get amped, and the away team doesn\u2019t get shaken.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s just another game for both squads.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Perhaps no phenomena are more closely statistically measured, tracked, and contested than sports.

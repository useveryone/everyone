										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Football without fans is nothing. It could be the greatest game in the world but if there are no people to watch it, it becomes nothing. Fans are the livelihood of the game”- Jock Stein.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it a strange time to be a football fan during the pandemic? The beautiful game we all are crazy about felt a bit different.</p>
<p>The absence of fans cheering at the stadium highlighted and still highlights how important they are to this beautiful game. Fans are the one true constant in football. Though now they are allowed in small numbers at select stadiums in the world, still it is not the same. While footballers may play the beautiful game, fans are what makes the game beautiful. The atmosphere, the rivalries, the traditions, fans impact the game like no other.</p>
<p>Managers and players come and go, but the fans remain till the end. The clubs we support, the nations we cheer on, are not just footballing entities, but also our way of life. The love or the support doesn’t fade even if the team is not winning or standing at the bottom of the league, take Arsenal for example.</p>
<p>Fans are what make the experience so special. Think about the last time you attended a game, I attended a friendly match between India and South Korea (B team) in Ahmedabad, though there were only 7000–8000 fans but the atmosphere gave me goosebumps. Now think if such a number can create such an impact what about places where football is a religion. Fans go crazy over a match and the stadiums are jam packed. It is said that when Borussia Dortmund plays at home, it doesn’t play with 11 players, but with 12- Twelfth one (the yellow wall) being the fans. The away team can feel the pressure of the fans and many a times, succumb to it.</p>
<p>The beautiful game was built upon the passion and emotions of the fans. Covid-19 has made everyone realize the importance of fans to not only football but to every game out there. They are the most important thing to the game. Now that they are allowed in to the stadiums to support and cheer for their clubs and countries it feels like the footballing world is getting back to normal. The Euro 2020 has also started after a one year wait with fans there in the stadiums to root for their countries, making us feel again that football is never just a game, it is an emotion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of football, there are certain players who capture the imagination of fans and pundits alike with their mesmerizing skills and ability to influence matches. One such player who has quietly been making waves and defying expectations is none other than Bruno Fernandes. Despite his outstanding performances and consistent impact on the pitch, Fernandes has often been overlooked and underrated in discussions about the world’s best footballers. However, a closer look at his game reveals a player who embodies the essence of a true football maestro.</p>
<p>Name a more consistent yet underrated player in the Premier league and even in the world. I’ll wait…</p>
<p>Since his arrival at Manchester United in January 2020, Fernandes has been a revelation. His impact on the team and the Premier League has been nothing short of extraordinary, yet his contributions have frequently been overshadowed by more high-profile names in the footballing world. It is time to shed light on the immense talent and significance that Bruno Fernandes brings to the beautiful game.</p>
<p>If you can put banter and team allegiance aside you would get to know why he is one of if not the best players to have graced the Premier league from the time of his arrival till now.</p>
<p>Fernandes has had his own fair share of criticism over the years he has been at United especially due to the fact that he is perceived to complain and moan about every decision that doesn’t go his way or his way of his team and also with the fact that he sometimes likes to go for the more intricate passes to his teammates which sometimes can be dangerous in the sense that it causes immediate turnovers to the opposition side when could probably well lead to a big chance or in some cases a goal.</p>
<p>That doesn’t take away the fact that the Portuguese maestro has been one of the most important players this season for Erik ten Hag and that’s why Fernandes earns so much praise and adulation from his manager and everyone associated with the club.</p>
<p>You should listen to the stadium when he goes over to take a corner… Deafening!</p>
<p>But why is Fernandes so unique? What makes him an integral part of his sides for both club and country?</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why he’s one of the most complete midfielders in the Premier league and on the planet.</p>
<p>Yes, the most complete…</p>
<p>Don’t worry I’ll give you the reasons why.</p>
<p>Read on!</p>
<p>Portugal and United’s number 8 possesses exceptional vision and creative prowess that enables him unlock stubborn defenses and create multiple chances for his teammates. He is blessed with the art of passing a football so precisely that it ends up in assists because they usually end up becoming big chances. Marcus Rashford has benefited greatly from this skillset the Portuguese maestro possess because he is most of the time on the end of it all he has that killer instinct to finish everything off.</p>
<p>A quite deadly combination…</p>
<p>Bruno Fernandes alongside Marcus Rashford.<br />
United’s lack of a classic number nine this term would be one of the reasons why Fernandes was unable to rack up a double digit of assists this term in the league. With his -6.4 expected assists, it’s way more than any player in the top five leagues across Europe but if ten Hag’s side are to get in a good striker then I’m sure Bruno’s numbers would improve massively in that respect. Bruno had eight assists in the Premier league and fifteen in all competitions.</p>
<p>Adding to the fact that he has a good passing range, Bruno Fernandes is not just your average playmaking midfielder because he also knows where the goal is and has a remarkable ability of finding the back of the net from various positions on the field. His accurate long-range shooting, set-piece expertise, and intelligent positioning make him a constant threat to opposing teams. United fans would remember his goal against Everton in 2021 as an example of his shooting ability.</p>
<p>An absolute peach!</p>
<p>It goes to show he can’t only just score from penalties.</p>
<p>Fernandes also has eight goals this term in the league and thirteen all competitions.</p>
<p>Wait, this man pulled a 28 goal contribution right under our noses and it’s not talked about. That’s crazy!</p>
<p>Fernandes consistently performs at a high level, delivering strong performances in almost every game he plays. His ability to maintain a consistent level in his performance in a United shirt has made him such a dependable player for The Red Devils coupled with the fact that he is never injured and the times he has been out of the side Manchester United have lost the games or have suffered in the games. They just don’t look a complete and attacking team without Fernandes pulling the strings in the middle.</p>
<p>Wait that’s not all…</p>
<p>The Midfield man is also a very versatile player for Erik ten Hag’s setup this season and has showed that he can play in numerous positions on the pitch. Bruno has played as an attacking midfielder, as a number 8 and even as a deep lying midfielder at times. In the attacking third he can play as a false nine and of both flanks.</p>
<p>I bet he’d probably give De Gea a run for his money in goal too…</p>
<p>His versatility provides tactical flexibility for the team in terms of how he can slot in for players unavailable or just being there for tactical tweaks mid games.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION.<br />
Bruno Fernandes has the most chances created in the league this season with 32 (119.0) and is only second to Lionel Messi in Europe’s top five leagues in that category.</p>
<p>Martinez, Casemiro and Rashford would be given a shout for who the most important player was this season for Manchester United but for me personally, Bruno Fernandes has been the most important player in United by a mile and has been the best signing for the club post Fergie era. If you are looking at consistency and availability then he’s right up there.</p>
<p>Overall, Bruno Fernandes’ impact on Manchester United cannot be overstated. His combination of creativity, goal-scoring ability, leadership, consistency, and versatility make him a crucial player for the team. His presence on the field significantly enhances United’s attacking threat and overall performance.</p>
<p>Do you think he’s still underrated?</p>
<p>Do you agree with me that he has been United’s most important player this season?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps no phenomena are more closely statistically measured, tracked, and contested than sports. Yet despite all the attributes and measures, one statistical point remains, in part, a mystery: why does the home team enjoy an advantage?</p>
<p>There’s been no shortage of theoretical explanations, like how crowd noise disrupts the visiting team’s performance or how local referees sway calls in favor of the home team.</p>
<p>These theories make sense, but, to me, the explanation is more obvious and elemental. The home team is amped up to play in front of their crowd and defend their turf, translating to an early adrenaline rush that gives them an edge when talent levels are relatively even.</p>
<p>It makes sense at face value. Home team entrances are so high-energy that I once briefly confused the University Of Texas’ marching band for their football team. The brass section was doing calisthenics like Jerry Rice before a playoff game. How often does this happen when the visiting team’s marching band takes the field? College football stadiums are the modern-day Coliseum. Home teams are psychologically battle-ready in a way that visiting teams are not.</p>
<p>Metaphors aside, I wanted to test this theory by digging into the data. My hypothesis is simple. The home team benefits from an initial rush of adrenaline that gives them a temporary bump in the game’s early stages. When turning to the data, this temporary boost should be visible in a performance trend that steadily diminishes over time as adrenaline fades and stamina wanes.</p>
<p>Pause here and ask yourself if you think this prediction is accurate. My guess is that you’re with me because everyone knows the home team plays tough early on.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the data says.</p>
<p>Preparing the Data And Analytics Approach<br />
To test my theory, I download game data from www.collegefootball.com (a fantastic website, check them out). To form the foundational data of my analysis, I grabbed data for 9 seasons (2013–2022, excluding 2020&#8217;s abnormal season). I then filtered by these criteria:</p>
<p>FBS division<br />
Conference games<br />
Games decided by 14 points or less<br />
Non-Neutral site games<br />
Games not decided in overtime<br />
These filters aimed to remove mismatches (conference powerhouses always win) and games where one team let off the gas in the fourth quarter after running up the score. All told the foundational data included about 2,200 games. Importantly, in these games, the home team won 53% of the time, and the away team won 47%.</p>
<p>The key metric I wanted to base my analysis on was win percentages by quarter for the home and away teams. If the home team scored more points in the first quarter, they won that quarter, and so on and so forth (note that this is on a per-quarter basis and is not cumulative).</p>
<p>Once I calculated the metric, I’d look for a spike in the home team’s win rates in the first quarter and then a gradual decline. That would at least support my theory in a general sense.</p>
<p>What The Data Showed<br />
Here’s a summary table of the data showing the win percentages for each quarter for the home and away teams and the delta between each quarter’s percentages.</p>
<p>Win Percentages By Quarter, Base Data From CollegeFootballData.com<br />
There are two things I’d like to point out here. First, notice that the first quarter is the only quarter with a significant difference in success rates between the home and away teams. The home team wins the first quarter ~42% of the time, while the away team wins ~37% of the time.</p>
<p>The second, third, and fourth-quarter win percentages are virtually identical between the home and away teams.</p>
<p>Now look at the trend line in the percentages for each team. The home team’s success is near steady. In contrast, the away team improves as the game goes on.</p>
<p>Here’s a side-by-side visualization of the win percentages by team.</p>
<p>Line Chart, Win Percentages<br />
My prediction was wrong (relative to home win rates alone, but not compared to away win rates). The home team’s win rate doesn’t peak early and then drop off. It stays more or less consistent. But curiously, the away team’s trend line is at an incline. The away team’s worst quarter is the first; they improve from there. What does this mean from my adrenaline dump theory? At this point, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how the home team wins versus how the away team wins.</p>
<p>Here’s the tabular data side by side:</p>
<p>Game Comparison: Home Wins Vs. Away Wins<br />
Notice that the pattern in the percentages is the same. The home team’s percentages are relatively consistent. Whereas the away team, even when it wins, sees a steady increase in success as the game progresses.</p>
<p>Also, regardless of victory or defeat, one thing is consistently true for the away team, their worst quarter is always the first. Comparatively, the home team’s worst quarter is always the third.</p>
<p>What’s the Takeaway?<br />
The data shows that the home team has more success against the away team in the first quarter and that the away team strikes a balance in the subsequent quarters.</p>
<p>But is this dynamic in any way related to home-field advantage? Does it do anything to explain why in this data set, the home team won 53% of the time?</p>
<p>In a sense, yes. The data tells the big-picture story. The away team’s general cadence of getting better over time results in a lesser win rate of 47%. Winning early is valuable in a competition between two teams where talent is matched evenly.</p>
<p>Still, what’s going on feels opaque without additional details. To add texture to the story, I included metrics for total points per quarter in the summary table. See the results below.</p>
<p>Total Points By Team and Quarter<br />
The home team scores more points overall, but the real difference is in the first quarter when the home team’s defense is uniquely effective.</p>
<p>Keeping a focus on the first quarter, I calculated the win percentages for the home and away teams when first-quarter points were removed from the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Without first-quarter points, the home team won ~48% of the time, and the away team ~46% (ties cover the remainder).<br />
Home team advantage isn’t erased without the first quarter, but the gap narrows. Overall, my theory feels pretty relevant from where I’m sitting. Tying it Back to Adrenaline</p>
<p>One often discussed theory about home-field advantage is that it’s linked to crowd noise. In general, the theory holds that the home-team crowd is louder while the away team is playing offense, interfering with their ability to hear the snap count and communicate.</p>
<p>But an excellent article by Josh Hermsmeyer in FiveThirtyEight undermines that theory.</p>
<p>However, there is indeed a correlation between crowd attendance and home-field advantage. During the 2020 NFL season, home-field advantage was non-existent when attendance was reduced or removed entirely, as this Washington Post article by Adam Kilgore and Neil Greenberg describes, quoted below:</p>
<p>Last year, with stadiums permitting either partial crowds or no fans at all, home-field advantage vanished. Road teams won more often for the first time on record, posting a .502 winning percentage.</p>
<p>After learning this, I thought, by chance, the key to understanding home-field advantage was comparing the circumstances in which it does not exist. While digging through my data, I removed my filter for the FBS division out of curiosity and instead filtered for divisions II and III.</p>
<p>Using this as my base data while keeping the original filters for competitive in-conference games, the significance of home-field advantage was smaller.</p>
<p>It had virtually disappeared: 50.12%/49.88%</p>
<p>Additionally, the breakdown of win percentages by quarter for each time was nearly an exact match:</p>
<p>Win percent by team for DII and DIII<br />
Sowhat’s the difference between a DII and DII home game and a DI home game? There are no D-Two or D-Three home games that look like this:</p>
<p>Home-field advantage is, in part, about the setting. When the crowd is raucous, when the pomp and circumstance is high, players feed off that energy and play more intensely.</p>
<p>That extra hype from being enmeshed in this setting gives home teams some added toughness early on. They play offense more explosively, and they play defense more aggressively.</p>
<p>It could be psychology; the visiting team is a bit shaken. Or it could be physical; the home team is more explosive when their surroundings inspire them the most. In any case, the visiting team has to weather the storm before finding their pace. Then things even out. And sometimes, the home team gasses, leaving the door open for a big third quarter for the away team.</p>
<p>In conditions with less energy, like the empty NFL stadiums in 2020 or the smaller DII and DIII stadiums, the home team doesn’t get amped, and the away team doesn’t get shaken.</p>
<p>It’s just another game for both squads.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another season for a Red Devil fan</p>
<p>With the 2022/23 season finished, it is time to review the past 12 months and highlight the positives and negatives of Erik ten Hag’s first season at the helm.</p>
<p>Compared to last season, Man Utd undoubtedly took a step forward by finishing third in the Premier League, with a total of 75 points. In comparison, last year, the Red Devils finished a lowly sixth, with only 58 points.</p>
<p>The Red Devils also finally won a trophy by clinching the League Cup in February 2023, the team’s first piece of silverware since 2017. Ten Hag’s team also reached the final of the FA Cup, and for periods of the season, Man Utd finally looked like a top team again, capable of going toe to toe with the best in Europe.</p>
<p>Despite the positives, there were also some negatives. The most important negative would be the gap to champions Manchester City, who scored 89 points to clinch another title.</p>
<p>Man Utd also showed a tendency to capitulate in some away games when things did not go according to plans. The most humiliating such episode was a 7–0 thumping suffered against arch-rivals Liverpool, but a 6–3 defeat against City, a 4–0 defeat against Brentford, and a 3–0 loss against Sevilla were also bitter pills to swallow for Man Utd fans.</p>
<p>This would be my review in short, but let’s look at the facts a bit more in detail.</p>
<p>Since the start of the season last summer, rumors were going wild about the rocky relationship between the new manager Erik ten Hag, and the team’s star player Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Ten Hag only played Ronaldo sporadically until the World Cup break arrived in November, then came the famous Piers Morgan interview that ended Cristiano Ronaldo’s Man Utd career.</p>
<p>Opinions were divided on whether United would be better off without Ronaldo or not, but with the assistance of hindsight, I think we can safely say now that the team was better off without Ronaldo.</p>
<p>And statistics back up this assertion. Up until the World Cup break, United’s track record in the league was 8 wins, 2 draws, and 4 losses after 14 games, leaving them fifth in the standings with a win percentage of 57%.</p>
<p>In the last 24 games of the season, United won 15 out of 24 league games, drew 3 times, and lost 5 times, rising to third in the standings with a win percentage of 62%.</p>
<p>Between late December and early March, United was also playing some excellent football, which saw them edge Xavi’s Barcelona in the Europe League, defeat Pep Guardiola’s Man City in the Manchester derby, and clinch the League Cup against Newcastle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the team’s form tailed off after March, and more patchy results came, as the pressure of too many games began to be seen, and some of the key players were forced to miss games through injury while others looked more and more tired.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite the hot and cold last three months of the season, I think ten Hag can be relatively happy with his first season at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>He succeeded in establishing himself as the top dog in the United dressing room, something Ralph Rangnick seemingly never succeeded in doing last year. The team seemingly also took the side of the manager in the feud between ten Hag and Ronaldo in the autumn, and the results improved in the aftermath of the World Cup.</p>
<p>During periods of the season, Man Utd also showed a winning team mentality and were not intimidated by going up against some of the best teams in Europe home or away.</p>
<p>Still, ten Hag knows that third place and a League Cup will not be enough to keep him at Old Trafford in the long run, as these are good results during a transitional season like this one, but the fans will be demanding improvements in the upcoming season(s).</p>
<p>The Dutch manager no doubt also knows what were the weaknesses that saw his team fall 14 points behind Man City in the standings.</p>
<p>First and most important issue for Man Utd to fix would be a lack of goals.</p>
<p>Just like last season, this year also, Man Utd struggled for goals and ended the 38-round league with a mere 58 goals. Compared to Man City’s 94, or Arsenal’s 88, Man Utd’s tally is very modest, and it is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently if the Red Devils want to challenge their rivals in the 2023/24 season.</p>
<p>Many players were already rumored to have been on the shopping list of the team, with Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen being at the top of the list of most fans.</p>
<p>The argument for Kane would be that he is already a seasoned veteran in the Premier League who has already shown that he got what it takes to succeed in England. Osimhen is a lot less accomplished than Kane and only really broke into stardom this year, but the 24-year-old Nigerian was one of the players of the season and played a major part in Napoli’s conquest of the Seria A.</p>
<p>If I could choose, I’d probably go for Kane as a safe pair of boots, but I’d be delighted if we could lend Osimhen also, as I think he is a super player with huge potential and a long career ahead of him.</p>
<p>Another issue that needs to be addressed urgently is the squad depth of Man Utd.</p>
<p>For me, the main reason why the form of the team tailed off in the spring was the lack of squad depth.</p>
<p>Though I was delighted to see Man Utd progress in all cup competitions during the winter months, this also meant that the team had an incredibly congested schedule, playing two games per week for months, and for the thin squad of Man Utd, this was unfortunately just too much this season.</p>
<p>Christian Eriksen went out injured for nearly two months, while Marcus Rashford was also far from fully fit in the last weeks of the season. Errors of judgment and tiredness also crept in during the spring, as the tiring Man Utd XI was stretched to its limit when ten Hag was unable to rotate his key players.</p>
<p>Ideally, 5–6 quality players should be signed this summer to both improve the starting XI in such positions as goalkeeper, full-backs, midfield, and attack, but also to give ten Hag more options to rotate during the season and keep his key players fresh for the really important games.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is probably more wishful thinking than reality, but the signing of a good goalkeeper, central midfielder, and forward should be an absolute must for the Red Devils if they want to improve next season.</p>
<p>Who these players might be is a difficult question. Rumors are going wild as usual. According to some, besides Kane and Osimhen, ten Hag is looking to sign Portugal’s Diogo Costa to bring competition for David de Gea, while West Ham skipper Declan Rice and Chelsea’s Mason Mount are also rumored to be among the potential signings requested by ten Hag.</p>
<p>Even if these three areas could be strengthened, ten Hag’s squad would lack the depth Pep Guardiola has, but this should allow ten Hag to close the gap to Man City and make his team a more promising prospect for talented players who would want to try their luck in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would say that as a fan, overall, I am happy with the job Erik ten Hag did at Old Trafford during the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Though I, like most other fans, expect to see improvements, we should remain with our feet on the ground and see this as a work in progress.</p>
<p>If we look at the two teams that finished ahead of us this year, we could see that neither Arteta and not even Guardiola were able to turn around their teams in 12 months.</p>
<p>Ten Hag’s place as a manager should not be above criticism by any means, but thanks to his track record at Ajax and his first season at Old Trafford, I think he earned the respect of the Man Utd fans, and we should trust him to be the right man to lead back United among the best teams of Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name is Kent Anderson and I’m an editor at Sports Raid, a Medium page. As it is the beginning of 2023, I thought it would be a good idea to put out a clarion call for new writers and submissions.</p>
<p>I have been a working journalist for 40-plus years. I’ve covered both college and pro sports and worked at both the Detroit News and Free Press, in addition to the Observer&amp;Eccentric newspaper chain during my time in the business. I have also been an assistant sports editor and sports editor at Wayne State University and Schoolcraft College. I have also been an editorial page columnist and writer for the defunct disability website icanonline.net.</p>
<p>While sports isn’t a huge topic here, it does play a huge role in society and impacts our lives more and more. From public funding of stadiums and arenas, to the proliferation of gambling in nearly every state and the sorry stories of harassment and ownership more interested in the art of appearances rather than concrete solutions, sports play an important role in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>I follow the AP stylebook, as well as common sense and logic-based writing and facts. Attributions and links to sources are also required. Facts matter as does the truth. Also, if you use ‘we,’ ‘I,’ or ‘our,’ in a piece, your article will be edited.</p>
<p>The best sports columnists I’ve ever read, Jerry Green of The Detroit News, Mike Downey of the Detroit Free Press, Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune and Dave Anderson of The New York Times, hardly ever injected themselves into their stories.</p>
<p>You immerse the reader into a narrative and tell a story. That’s what grabs a reader, not the writer’s experience. Journalism, especially sports journalism, is about people who make the news, not those reporting it. It seems to have turned into that recently.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there’s plenty to write about these days. Whether it’s the hypocrisy of the NCAA, the corruption of FIFA and the IOC, the NFL’s battle over turf surfaces, LIV golf and the PGA, the rise of women’s sports, MLB’s continuing quest to stay relevant in a changing society and the brilliance of Connor McDavid (or as an old hockey writer friend calls him ‘Connor McJesus’).</p>
<p>That’s a lot of material to cover. So, send your submissions and join me in providing insight and analysis into sport and the business of sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one ever died wishing they’d worked more, she said, rightness written all over her pretty face.</p>
<p>Dig taken.</p>
<p>I don’t know, I said.</p>
<p>No one ever died wishing they’d watched one more episode of Friends, either I say and she rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>No one ever died wishing they’d kept the house cleaner, either I say.</p>
<p>Untold hours folding laundry, sweeping floors, mopping floors, and pushing the mawing beast to hoover up dust bunnies that will magically reappear in the same damn spot again next week, and the week after.</p>
<p>But we keep doing it, don’t we?</p>
<p>Did you know, I say, if you spend an hour every day cleaning the house and live to the ripe old age of 80, you’ll have spent over one thousand days of your life cleaning the damn house?</p>
<p>What could you have done with a thousand days?</p>
<p>Face pinched, she won’t look at me, but I keep talking because I never did know when to shut my big mouth.</p>
<p>And does anyone appreciate it? I mean, really.</p>
<p>Beyond the cursory ‘thanks, Mom’ and ‘great dinner, honey,’ does anyone really and truly appreciate that this is how you’re spending the hours of your one wild and precious life?</p>
<p>Time is a currency, I say softly.</p>
<p>A measure of exchange. Just like money. Except you can never, ever get more of it once you’ve spent it.</p>
<p>She shoots me a look and I exhale breath I didn’t know I was holding.</p>
<p>See, this is why we’re blood, I tell her. Because you’d never tolerate having someone like me in your peripheral vision if I wasn’t blood and her face tells me I scored but the win falls flat.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, I say and she finally looks at me.</p>
<p>Isaac Asimov once said if his doctor told him he was dying, he wouldn’t lament, he would just type a little faster.</p>
<p>I can’t wait until it’s too late, I say so quietly it’s almost inaudible.</p>
<p>She doesn’t say a word, but I see something flicker in her eyes and around her mouth, and for one tiny moment in time, I feel seen.</p>
<p>I was all of ten when I regaled Mom with my brilliant math skills. I was rocking my baby brother to sleep while she gathered up supper dishes. He was a surprise menopause baby and oh, how she treasured that little boy, never mind that she was already a grandma.</p>
<p>Mama, did you know you’ve been pregnant for six whole years of your life?</p>
<p>The look on her face instantly told me I’d said something terribly, horribly wrong and inappropriate, but I wasn’t even sure what, or why.</p>
<p>I know, she said and filled the sink to wash the dishes.</p>
<p>Kissing his head, I laid him in the crib and grabbed a dishtowel. I’ll help, I said. Standing beside her, drying dishes, I asked the big scary question.</p>
<p>Mom? Do you ever wish you didn’t have us?</p>
<p>Waiting, my lip quivered.</p>
<p>Oh sweetheart, she said. Hands still in the dishwater, she leaned over and kissed my head. Lifted my chin with a wet hand to look me in the eye. No, she said, she doesn’t wish that. Never, not ever. Not even for one single minute, sweetheart, she said. You kids are my everything.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I believed her. Not until I had my own.</p>
<p>Mama, she said.</p>
<p>I look at her, delighted.</p>
<p>What did you say? Say it again!</p>
<p>Mama, she repeats, pointing a tiny finger at me. I scoop her up and dance around the room. Yes, I tell her. Yes, I’m your mama.</p>
<p>I phone mom and when she picks up, I don’t even say hello first. She said mama, I blurt and we laugh. Mothers, both of us.</p>
<p>We put a growth chart on the wall and got a book for all the firsts. Walked at nine months, used full sentences by her first birthday, and learned to read before pre-school, this precious, precocious child of mine.</p>
<p>They say having a child is like taking a little piece of your heart and letting it walk around independent of you and they’re not wrong. I didn’t know I could love so much. So, so much.</p>
<p>And to think Mom tried to talk me out of all of this, back when I was dating the boyfriend I would eventually marry.</p>
<p>You’re so young, she’d said. So young.</p>
<p>We need to stop raising our kids on fairy tales. What a shock to grow up and realize the fairy tale works backward.</p>
<p>After you wear the pretty white gown and glass slippers and say I do, you get to be the version of Cinderella from the beginning of the story, cooking and cleaning until you drop, weeping, into a corner somewhere.</p>
<p>There’s no fairy godmother so we wash diapers, dishes, and laundry and push the mawing beast to hoover the dust bunnies, but not when the baby is sleeping because, trust me, you really, really need her to nap.</p>
<p>And somewhere along the way, a year or ten later, we start to wonder if this is all there is. Not that we don’t love our kids, because we do. With every fiber of our being.</p>
<p>But still. We remember who we were, once upon a time.</p>
<p>Before we were wives and mothers.</p>
<p>Me, I was born half-wild.</p>
<p>Running wild, climbing trees while the others played house and had tea parties. Rode bareback before I started school and Mom was so angry at Dad for allowing it. But look at her, he’d said. Look how happy she is.</p>
<p>I wish that child would wear shoes, Mom sighed but I still don’t.</p>
<p>They start when you least expect it, the dreams. Maybe the thousandth time you’re washing dishes, or pushing the vacuum. Maybe you see something on tv or in a magazine, and suddenly? There they are.</p>
<p>I could see it so clearly.</p>
<p>Flying down the road at breakneck speeds while cars flew by going the opposite way, getting the hell out of dodge. Wind screaming through my hair as I pointed the eye of the camera into the eye of the storm.</p>
<p>Laying in a field, so still that wild birds mistook me for just another dead tree and perched on my head while I lay utterly still, watching for the wild animal that would inevitably appear for me to capture on film.</p>
<p>I remembered the camera I’d bought with my babysitting money at all of thirteen. When I whispered those dreams to Mom, she said she knows. She wanted to be a nurse, once upon a time. So much she could taste it.</p>
<p>It’s not just women, lest you misunderstand this as a feminist rant.</p>
<p>I can still see him bent over a blueprint. He was so smart, I believed he could move the world if he chose. He dreamed of being an architect, designing the kinds of buildings they show in Architectural Digest.</p>
<p>He’d buy them with his pay from packing groceries on Saturdays.</p>
<p>But he met a girl. I threw rice at their wedding. Then he folded up his dream and tucked it in his back pocket. Got the job that would give his family security instead of uncertainty. Because he, too, loved.</p>
<p>Last week I saw a woman crying about a filter on TikTok. The filter made her younger. Oh, that little face, she said. That precious little face.</p>
<p>She didn’t even turn off the camera when the tears started. It wasn’t a lament on aging. You know? Aging is a gift.</p>
<p>It’s not that we enjoy aging. Not that I’ll enjoy wrinkles when they show up. If my siblings are any indication, it will be some time yet and I’m grateful to my parents for the genes.</p>
<p>Give me aging over the alternative.</p>
<p>But that little face? She still had her whole life in front of her.</p>
<p>No one tells you the hardest part of getting older.</p>
<p>It’s not wrinkles or grey hair. It’s not the five or ten extra pounds.</p>
<p>You wake up one day and everything changed. No more little faces around the breakfast table. No 6 AM hockey practice. No dance recitals, sleepover parties, or class trips. Not a single argument over curfew.</p>
<p>It’s all done. Faded into history.</p>
<p>Oh sure, there are tradeoffs. Grandkids, maybe. Less laundry. Delightful Saturday lunch and shopping with this amazing adult you made.</p>
<p>But your life? There are holes in it they used to fill.</p>
<p>And now they don’t.</p>
<p>So you reach into your back pocket for the dreams you were going to chase one day, when you finally had time. Only to discover they’re gone, too.</p>
<p>In the flurry of adulting, parenting, and bill paying, you didn’t even notice when your dreams slipped through the hourglass.</p>
<p>Gone. Along with the sands of time.</p>
<p>That’s the hard part.</p>
<p>I asked Mom, once, why she never became a nurse after the kids grew up. She sighed and said twelve-hour days had no appeal to her anymore. She did enough of those as a mother. I nodded. Understood.</p>
<p>What do you do then, with your pockets empty of dreams?</p>
<p>If you’re one of the lucky ones, you find a new dream.</p>
<p>Most people don’t.</p>
<p>They just fill their hours with television and routine. Know what the top regret of the dying is? They wish they’d had the courage to live a life true to themselves instead of doing what other people expected them to.</p>
<p>I can’t die that way. I can’t.</p>
<p>But I don’t have to. Julia Child started cooking at 51. Laura Ingalls Wilder started writing the Little House books at 65. Grandma Moses didn’t pick up a paintbrush until she was 77.</p>
<p>I still work, because of divorce, inflation, and bills.</p>
<p>I still push the mawing beast, because houses don’t clean themselves.</p>
<p>And so I sit, typing as the sun sinks behind the old maple tree outside my window and wake with the robins to draw in the early morning light.</p>
<p>I may well die wishing I’d worked a little more.</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>I don’t have a crystal ball. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know. But there’s one thing I know for sure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past six months, I’ve been working at series A startup Voxel51, a and creator of the open source computer vision toolkit FiftyOne. As a machine learning engineer and developer evangelist, my job is to listen to our open source community and bring them what they need — new features, integrations, tutorials, workshops, you name it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we added native support for vector search engines and text similarity queries to FiftyOne, so that users can find the most relevant images in their (often massive — containing millions or tens of millions of samples) datasets, via simple natural language queries.</p>
<p>This put us in a curious position: it was now possible for people using open source FiftyOne to readily search datasets with natural language queries, but using our documentation still required traditional keyword search.</p>
<p>We have a lot of documentation, which has its pros and cons. As a user myself, I sometimes find that given the sheer quantity of documentation, finding precisely what I’m looking for requires more time than I’d like.</p>
<p>I was not going to let this fly… so I built this in my spare time:</p>
<p>So, here’s how I turned our docs into a semantically searchable vector database:</p>
<p>Converted all of the docs to a unified format<br />
Split docs into blocks and added some automated cleanup<br />
Computed embeddings for each block<br />
Generated a vector index from these embedding<br />
Defined the index query<br />
Wrapped it all in a user-friendly command line interface and Python API<br />
You can find all the code for this post in the voxel51/fiftyone-docs-search repo, and it’s easy to install the package locally in edit mode with pip install -e ..</p>
<p>Better yet, if you want to implement semantic search for your own website using this method, you can follow along! Here are the ingredients you’ll need:</p>
<p>Install the openai Python package and create an account: you will use this account to send your docs and queries to an inference endpoint, which will return an embedding vector for each piece of text.<br />
Install the qdrant-client Python package and launch a Qdrant server via Docker: you will use Qdrant to create a locally hosted vector index for the docs, against which queries will be run. The Qdrant service will run inside a Docker container.<br />
Converting the docs to a unified format<br />
My company’s docs are all hosted as HTML documents at https://docs.voxel51.com./ A natural starting point would have been to download these docs with Python’s requests library and parse the document with Beautiful Soup.</p>
<p>As a developer (and author of many of our docs), however, I thought I could do better. I already had a working clone of the GitHub repository on my local computer that contained all of the raw files used to generate the HTML docs. Some of our docs are written in Sphinx ReStructured Text (RST), whereas others, like tutorials, are converted to HTML from Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>I figured (mistakenly) that the closer I could get to the raw text of the RST and Jupyter files, the simpler things would be.</p>
<p>RST<br />
In RST documents, sections are delineated by lines consisting only of strings of =, &#8211; or _. For example, here’s a document from the FiftyOne User Guide which contains all three delineators:</p>
<p>I could then remove all of the RST keywords, such as toctree, code-block, and button_link (there were many more), as well as the :, ::, and .. that accompanied a keyword, the start of a new block, or block descriptors.</p>
<p>Links were easy to take care of too:</p>
<p>Things started to get dicey when I wanted to extract the section anchors from RST files. Many of our sections had anchors specified explicitly, whereas others were left to be inferred during the conversion to HTML.</p>
